# A summary of Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software produced. It provides a framework for a standard set of activities and deliverables throughout the software development process. The key stages of the SDLC include:

1. **Requirement Collection and Analysis**: Senior team members conduct an in-depth analysis of requirements gathered from stakeholders.

2. **Feasibility Study**: This stage evaluates the feasibility of the project, considering technical, economic, and operational factors.

3. **Design**: System and software design documents are prepared based on the requirements, outlining the architecture and functionality of the software.

4. **Coding**: Developers write code according to the design specifications using the chosen programming language.

5. **Testing**: The application undergoes rigorous testing to verify that it meets customer requirements and functions as intended.

6. **Installation/Deployment**: Once testing is complete and any issues are resolved, the software is deployed to the production environment.

7. **Maintenance**: Bug fixing, upgrades, and enhancements are carried out to ensure the software remains functional and up-to-date throughout its lifecycle.

Popular SDLC models include Waterfall, Incremental, Agile, V Model, Spiral, and Big Bang. Each model has its own approach to the stages of development and is chosen based on project requirements and constraints. Overall, the SDLC consists of a detailed plan that guides the planning, development, and maintenance of specific software products.
