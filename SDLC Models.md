# The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models

Popular SDLC Models

The software development life cycle (SDLC) encompasses various methodologies for the development and maintenance of software systems. One widely recognized model is the V-Model, characterized by its documentation-intensive approach and sequential execution of processes in a V-shaped manner. Below are some of the key phases of the SDLC life cycle:

1. V-Model

The V-Model is an extension of the traditional waterfall model, often referred to as the Verification and Validation model. It emphasizes the association of testing phases with corresponding development stages, ensuring a systematic approach to software development. In this model, each phase of development is directly followed by a testing phase, promoting a disciplined and methodical progression through the project lifecycle.

V-Model - Design

In the V-Model, testing phases are planned concurrently with development phases, forming a distinct pattern resembling a 'V'. On one side of the V, verification phases ensure that each stage of development meets specified requirements, while on the other side, validation phases validate the software against user expectations and needs. The Coding Phase serves as the bridge between these two sides of the V-Model, facilitating the integration of development and testing efforts.

There are several verification phases in the V-Model, each of which is explained in detail below:

1. Business Requirement Analysis

This initial phase of the development cycle involves understanding the product requirements from the customer's perspective. Detailed communication with the customer is crucial to grasp their expectations and exact needs, considering that many customers may not have a clear understanding of their requirements. This phase lays the foundation for acceptance test design planning, as business requirements serve as inputs for acceptance testing.

2. System Design

Once the product requirements are clear and detailed, the focus shifts to designing the complete system. System design entails understanding and detailing the entire hardware and communication setup for the product under development. Developing the system test plan based on the system design is critical, as doing so early in the process allows more time for actual test execution later on.

3. Architectural Design

In this phase, architectural specifications are understood and designed, often involving the proposal of multiple technical approaches. The final decision is made based on technical and financial feasibility. The system design is further broken down into modules, each handling different functionalities. This phase, also known as High-Level Design (HLD), clearly defines data transfer and communication between internal modules and with external systems. Integration tests can be designed and documented during this stage based on this information.

4. Module Design

This phase focuses on specifying the detailed internal design for all system modules, referred to as Low-Level Design (LLD). It's crucial for the design to be compatible with other modules in the system architecture and with external systems. Unit tests play a vital role in identifying faults and errors at an early stage, and designing them based on internal module designs can help eliminate maximum issues.
